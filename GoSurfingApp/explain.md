Here's a Python implementation of the decision-making node for predicting whether or not to go surfing based on the given example:

# Define input variables (1 = yes, 0 = no)
```
X1 = 1  # Good waves
X2 = 0  # Empty lineup
X3 = 1  # Shark-free zone
```

# Define weights
```
W1 = 5  # Importance of good waves
W2 = 2  # Importance of less crowded lineup
W3 = 4  # Importance of avoiding sharks
```

# Define bias (threshold)
```
bias = -3
```

# Compute the output (Y-hat)
```
Y_hat = (X1 * W1) + (X2 * W2) + (X3 * W3) - bias
```

# Determine if the output is greater than 0
```
if Y_hat > 0:
    print("Output: 1 (Weâ€™re going surfing!)")
else:
    print("Output: 0 (No surfing today.)")
```

# Display the computed value
```
print(f"Y_hat: {Y_hat}")
```

You can adjust the input variables **(X1, X2, X3),** weights **(W1, W2, W3),** or bias to explore how different factors influence the decision-making process.
